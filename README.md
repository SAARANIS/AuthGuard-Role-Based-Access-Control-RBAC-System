# SecureRBAC: Access Control System

A Lightweight, CLI-Based Access Control System in Python
Tired of bulky authentication systems? AccessVault is your minimalist solution for managing users, permissions, and resourcesâ€”all from the command line. Perfect for small-scale apps or prototyping security layers!

ðŸš€ Why AccessVault?
No databases, no fuss: Stores data in simple files (thanks, pickle!).

Human-friendly commands: Type python auth.py AddUser bob 1234 instead of wrestling with GUIs.

RBAC made simple: Assign users to domains, tag objects with types, and control access like a pro.

Instant checks: CanAccess("delete", "bob", "report.xlsx") gives you a yes/no in seconds.

ðŸ’» Quick Start
Add a user:

bash
Copy
python auth.py AddUser alice p@ssw0rd  
Grant permissions:

bash
Copy
python auth.py AddAccess "edit" "admin" "document"  
Check access:

bash
Copy
python auth.py CanAccess "edit" "alice" "budget.xlsx"  
(Output: Success or Error: access denied)
